# Hacktoberfest 2023 Starter Kit: Your First Open Source Contributions
Last year, being my first time participating in Hacktoberfest, I encountered some difficulties. Many repositories I contributed to were considered invalid by the platform. Therefore, this year, I have decided to create a small list of all the repositories I participate in and that are accepted. I will try to emphasize the simpler ones, especially for those who are participating for the first time, and share them with the community.

I present a curated list of awesome Hacktoberfest 2023 repositories. If you enjoyed this resource, please leave a star ⭐ to support this project! 

If you wish to contribute by adding repositories to be listed here or by sharing repositories that have been excluded from Hacktoberfest, please submit a pull request.✨

# What is Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest is an annual event in October where people from all over the world contribute to open source projects on platforms like GitHub. The goal is to encourage participation in the open source community and provide a starting point for newcomers to get involved in open source development. Participants complete a certain number of pull requests (PRs) during the month to earn cool swag and support the open source community.

This year, if you manage to complete 4 high-quality pull requests, you have the chance to earn your [digital reward](https://hacktoberfest.com/about/#digital-rewards) All you have to do to take part is:

1. Sign up on the [Official Hacktoberfest Website](https://hacktoberfest.com/auth)
2. Make 4 **quality** pull requests to any **participating** public repository during the month of October.
3. Have fun

This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will have a tree planted in their name!

You can find out more details about Hacktoberfest on their website, as well as track your progress throughout the month.

They currently have [three projects for Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Hacktoberfest-2023). Please take a look at the link to contribute to one of them.

### A-Z-Python-Projects
If you are a beginner and want to participate in Hacktoberfest with Python code, [A-Z-Python-Projects](https://github.com/Techiral/A-Z-Python-Projects) is the place for you. In this repository, you will find a curated collection of Python projects from A to Z, designed for beginners to advanced developers.

The [FunnyAlgorithms](https://github.com/ReciHub/FunnyAlgorithms) repository is a platform dedicated to the collection and sharing of humorous or unconventional algorithms. It's a place where developers and coding enthusiasts come together to create and share algorithms that are meant to be entertaining rather than strictly practical.

The mission of the [Development Projects Collections](https://github.com/Nikhil-2002/development_Hactoberfest23) is to empower code beginners on their journey to becoming open-source contributors. The initiative acknowledges that the first pull request can be a daunting step, but it aims to transform it into an exciting and successful experience.

### Reduced.to
[Reduced.to](https://github.com/origranot/reduced.to) is a modern web application that reduces the length of link URL. There are some bugs to be resolved.
